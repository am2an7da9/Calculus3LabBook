        The goal of this activity is to help us understand how we develop the Lagrange multiplier equation <m>\nabla f(x,y)=\lambda \nabla g(x,y)</m> and to visualize finding extreama on a surface subject to a constraint.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Find the relative extreama of the function <m>f (x, y) = x^{2} + y^{2} + 2x - 2y + 1</m> subject to the constraint, <m>g(x, y) = x^{2} + y^{2} = 2</m> subject to the given constraint, showing all work.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Graph the function from above in CalcPlot3D (<alert>see and create its contour plot and attach it to get credit for this problem</alert>)using the following steps:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Enter <m>x^{2} + y^{2} + 2x - 2y + 1</m> in the first function.
                            Zoom out once so the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>values range from <m>-4</m> to <m>4</m>.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            To obtain the contour plot, click on the contour plot button below the function definition.
                            (See the icon shown in part 4 above.)
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            On the Contour Plot Settings dialog, enter <alert>First level value: <m>-1</m>, Step size: 1, and Number of contours: 10.</alert>
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            To display the constraint curve, select the third option on the <alert>Add Constraint Curve</alert> menu.
                            This option is: <alert>Circle centered at origin</alert>.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <alert>Enter 2</alert> in the box representing <m>\mathbf{R}^{2}</m> and use the chevrons to go back to the main level of <alert>Contour Plot Settings</alert>.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Now click on the <alert>Create Plot</alert> button in this dialog, and you should see the contour plot and the constraint curve appear.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            By default, the gradient vectors of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are displayed, <em> <m>\nabla f</m> is red</em> and <em> <m>\nabla g</m> is blue</em>.
                            To watch them vary along the constraint curve, use the scrollbar located at the bottom of the 3D plot.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Note: we can visually verify that these gradient vectors are either parallel to each other or <em> <m>\nabla f=0</m> </em> when we obtain a relative extremum of <m>f</m> subject to the constraint, in both cases satisfying the Lagrange Multiplier equation.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Now click on the contour plot in the large 3D plot window.
                            The surface above will appear.
                            Use the right arrow key to rotate the 3D graph to the right about the z-axis until you see a clear view of the relative extrema.
                            Then use the scrollbar again to move along the trace of the constraint curve on the surface to verify the relative extrema we found earlier.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Click on the contour plot and print a view of the surface (along with the contours and the constraint curve projected on the surface) that makes it possible to see both extrema clearly.
                Add a screenshot or include a URL of the graph.
                Remember you can go to file - to save the image as a png or to encode the view in a URL.

                Let <m>z=f(x,y)</m> represent the elevations in a mountainous area represented by the contour plot below:

            <p>
                Suppose you are taking a hike along a circular route.
                On the contour plot, mark all of the relative high points and low points you encountered along your hike.
                Then indicate with an “x” the absolute highest and lowest elevations that you encountered during your hike.
                Remember to stay on your circular hiking trail.
                Compare what you picked using <url href="{">https</url>://c3d.libretexts.org/CalcPlot3D/index.html?type=z;z=-0.2e

        <li>
            <p>
                Now look at where the high and low points of our functions occur using the contour plot above and the visualization in CalcPlot3D.
                What seems to be the relationship between the constraint curve and the contours of the function f at these low and high points? (It is clearer at two of the points than the others.) Why does this make sense?
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Could we identify all of these points just by looking at the constraint curve on the contour plot as if it were a trail map(without having seen the 3D surface)? If so, how? What would we be looking for?
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Draw in (and label) a vector at one of these points to represent the direction of the gradient of f at the point.
                Let’s consider the constraint curve to be a level curve of a second function of two variables.
                If we call this function g, draw in (and label) any vector(s) that represent(s) the direction of the gradient of g at this same point.
                What do you notice about the relationship between the gradient vectors of f and g here? (You should draw something that looks like <url href="{">https</url>://c3d.libretexts.org/CalcPlot3D/index.html?type=z;z=-0.2e
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Let’s use what we just learned to determine the absolute maximum and minimum values of <m>f(x,y)=2x^{3}+y^{4}</m>, subject to the constraint of the unit circle (<m>x^{2}+y^{2}=1</m>).
                Start by drawing in all the Lagrange points on the contour plot of <m>f</m> below/next page in Figure fig:plot2.
                Approximate the coordinates and function values at each of these points.
                Then state the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of <m>f</m> subject to this constraint indicating where each occurs.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Change the <m>b</m> value to draw the path one would travel on our surface subject to the constraint of the unit circle using <url href="{">https</url>://c3d.libretexts.org/CalcPlot3D/index.html?type=z;z=2x
