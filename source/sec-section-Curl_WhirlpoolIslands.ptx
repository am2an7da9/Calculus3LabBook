    <p>
        In this lab we will:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Use an LLM to create a vector field which models 
                ocean currents with whirlpools at certain locations. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Calculate the curl of the currents at different locations.
            </p>
        </li>
            <li>
            <p>
                Understand of the meaning of the values of the curl 
                in the context of the model.
            </p>
