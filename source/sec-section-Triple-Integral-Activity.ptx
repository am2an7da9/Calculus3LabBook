    <p>
        Steps to graph a region:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Go to CalcPlot3D. (It may be useful to deselect the current graph or delete it.)
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Use <q>Add to graph</q> and select <em>region</em>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Add values and functions to describe your region. Note that CalcPlot3D, as of right now, only considers a top region in the form of <m>z=f(x,y)</m> (not those in the form of <m>y=f(x,z)</m> or <m>x=f(y,z)</m>). You can add this surface at the bottom under 3D Plot. The 2D Plot defaults to a function in the form of <m>y=f(x)</m>, but you can select <m>x=f(y)</m> if this is useful. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Don't forget to press enter so your region shows up!
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

  <statement>
    <p>
        Work with your group on the following questions which will help us explore the <alert>wacky world</alert> of Triple Integrals!
    </p>
  </statement>

  <exercise>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Use CalcPlot3D to view the region bounded by the following: 
                <me>-2\leq y\leq 2, \qquad  0\leq x\leq \sqrt{4-y^2}, \qquad \text{ and } \qquad 1\leq z \leq 2+x</me>.
            </p>
        </statement>

        <statement>
            <hint>
            <p>
                Notice that the default is for <m>y</m> to be a function of <m>x</m>. The button <m>x=f(y)</m> may be helpful.
            </p>
            </hint>
        </statement>
        
        <statement>
            <p>
                Then write a triple integral which calculates the volume of this region.
            </p>
        </statement>
  </exercise>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
        <p>
            Sketch the solid whose volume is given by the iterated integral 
            <me>\displaystyle\int_0^1\int_0^{1-x}\int_0^{2-2y-2x}dzdydx</me>. 
            Check your answer in CalcPlot3D. 
        </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
        <p>
            Sketch the solid whose volume is given by the iterated integral 
            <me>\displaystyle\int_0^1\int_0^{1-y}\int_0^{2-2y-2x}dzdxdy</me>. 
            Check your answer in CalcPlot3D. 
        </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
        <p>
            Would this integral represent the volume of the same region as the previous questions 
            <me>\displaystyle\int_0^1\int_0^{1-x}\int_0^{2-2z-2x}dydzdx</me>? 
            If so, explain your reasoning. If not, explain how the region described by this integral is different. 
        </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
        <p>
            Archer and Eva, the amazing math kitties, are working on switching the order of integration to convert 
            <me>\displaystyle\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}}\int_0^{1-2x}\int_0^{1-y-2x}dzdydx</me> 
            into the form of <m>\iiint dzdxdy</m>. Archer shares his answer 
            <me>\displaystyle\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}}\int_0^{1-2y}\int_0^{1-x-2y}dzdxdy</me>. 
            What would you say to him? Help Eva correct his work and discuss any misconceptions he may have in his setup.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
        <p>
            Consider the integral 
            <me>\displaystyle\int_0^1\int_0^{1-x}\int_0^{2-2z}dydzdx</me>. 
            Sketch the solid represented by this triple integral and compare it with the solids you found with CalcPlot3D for the previous questions.
        </p>
    </statement>

    <statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                You may want to reorder the problem so that it is in the form of <m>\iiint dzdydx</m> so you can use CalcPlot 3D to sketch the solid.
            </p>
        </hint>
    </statement>
  </exercise>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
        <p>
            Consider the integral
            <me>\displaystyle\int_{-1}^1\int_{x^2}^{1}\int_0^{1-y}dzdydx</me>.

            <task>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        Sketch the region and check your answer in CalcPlot3D.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </task>

            <task>

                    <p>
                        The magnificent math kitty, Archer, is asked to rewrite this integral as an integral of the form <m>\int\int\int dydzdx</m>. He shares his bounds to be 
                        <me>-1\leq x\leq 1,  \qquad 0 \leq z\leq 1, \qquad x^2\leq y \leq 1</me>. 
                        Use CalcPlot3D to verify that his region is correct. If not, discuss what misconception he has potentially made and correct his work.
