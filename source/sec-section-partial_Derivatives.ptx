            In this activity, we will explore the geometric interpretation
             of the partial derivative as the slope of a tangent line. 
            <url href="https://davidmathlogic.com/amit/partialderivatives.html" visual="This little app" /> , 
            may be useful to review to provide an example of what <m> f_x </m> and <m>f_y </m> represent 
            at a point (App is created by Dr. David Nichols). 
First we <alert> Highly RECOMMEND </alert> 
reviewing <url href="https://c3d.libretexts.org/CalcPlot3D/index.html?exploration=ahr-activity1" visual="this demonstration"/> in CalcPlot3D and having it up in a separate tab while you work on the problem set below.

        <p>
          Consider finding the equation of the line that lies in the plane <m>y=2 </m> and is tangent
       to the graph of <m>f(x,y)=\sqrt{y-x^2}</m> when <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=2</m>. (<m>x=1</m>
        is used in the demonstration above). 
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              To find the equation of a line in space, you need a point that lies on the 
       line and a direction vector. <alert> What is the point and direction vector in this situation?</alert>
        Please note that your line will remain in the plane <m> y=2</m>, so your vector
         will not vary in the <m>y</m> direction.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
          Write an equation for the tangent line in vector form.
          </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In CalcPlot3D, <alert> plot the surface, the point of tangency, the plane <m>y=2</m>, 
                and the tangent line you found.</alert>
                 Provide a screenshot of this for this problem. Note if your line does not appear to be
                  tangent, you may need to review the computations used to find the tangent line.
                   Once you are confident you have the correct plot, provide a screenshot or send
                    the URL of your plot with the instructor (to do the latter go to the 3 lines in 
                    the upper left side of Calcplot3D select file then select encode view in URL).
            </p>

      Now we will relate the tangent line you obtained to the concept of tangent lines 
      learned in Calculus I. 
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Write the symmetric equations for the tangent line you found in 1(b).
          </p>
        </li>
          <li>
          <p> Solve the symmetric equation for <m>z</m>  in terms of <m>x</m>. 
            We will call this Equation I.
          </p>
        </li>
          <li>
          <p> Consider <m>z=\sqrt{y-x^2}</m>. Substitute <m>y=2</m> into this equation to obtain a 
            single variable function.
             This represents the trace in the plane <m>y=2</m>. 
          </p>
        </li>
          <li>
          <p> Find the equation of the line tangent to this single variable function at <m>x=1</m>. 
            Call this Equation II.
          </p>
        </li>
          <li>
          <p> Equations I and II should be equivalent. This shows that the partial derivative at a point will give us the slope of a line tangent to a trace curve, 
            which is equivalent to the Calculus I concept of finding slopes of tangent lines in a plane.
