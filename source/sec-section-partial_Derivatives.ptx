            may be useful to review to provide an example of what <m> f_x </m> and <m>f_y </m> represent 
            at a point (App is created by Dr. David Nichols). 
First we <alert> Highly RECOMMEND </alert> reviewing <url  href="https://c3d.libretexts.org/CalcPlot3D/index.html?exploration=ahr-activity1" value="this demonstration" /> in CalcPlot3D and having it up in a separate tab while you work on the problem set below.
