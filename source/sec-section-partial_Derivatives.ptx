            In this activity, we will explore the geometric interpretation
             of the partial derivative as the slope of a tangent line.

            may be useful to review to provide an example of what <m> f_x </m> and <m>f_y </m> represent 
            at a point (App is created by Dr. David Nichols). 
First we <alert> Highly RECOMMEND </alert> 
reviewing <url href="https://c3d.libretexts.org/CalcPlot3D/index.html?exploration=ahr-activity1" visual="this demonstration"/> in CalcPlot3D and having it up in a separate tab while you work on the problem set below.

          Consider finding the equation of the line that lies in the plane <m>y=2 </m> and is tangent
       to the graph of <m>f(x,y)=\sqrt{y-x^2}</m> when <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=2</m>. (<m>x=1</m>
        is used in the demonstration above).

  <statement>
    <p>
       To find the equation of a line in space, you need a point that lies on the 
       line and a direction vector. <alert> What is the point and direction vector in this situation?</alert>
        Please note that your line will remain in the plane <m> y=2</m>, so your vector
         will not vary in the <m>y</m> direction.
