<p>
    Math 480 History Project Due Thursday, May 30, 2018 Choose a mathematician from the list given on page 3.
    A maximum of two students may sign up for the same mathematician.
    Sign up for your mathematician on the Google Doc sent to your CSUSB email address.
    First come, first served.
    This must be done by Thursday, May 9th.
</p>

<p>
    Write a job application letter and résumé as if it were being written by your mathematician.
    The “job” that your mathematician is applying for may be real or fictional, but should in some way fit with his/her character and skills.
    Your mathematician cannot apply to be a professor.
    The job letter must be 1 full page and include all of the following: the name of the job, why this mathematician is applying, and why this mathematician is qualified for the position (specifically address how your mathematician’s background fits the job).
    The résumé must be at least 1 page, but no more than 2 pages.
    The following categories must be included: Personal Information (name and address/contact info) Education Job Experience Publications and/or famous results Professional Societies, if any Relevant Interests References (at least one)
</p>

<p>
    Write 2 journal entries as if they were being written by your mathematician.
    These entries should tell an interesting story or anecdote related to your mathematician’s life.
    The journal entries should be at least one paragraph each, but no more than 1 page total.
</p>

<p>
    Thoroughly describe some mathematical result or discovery that your mathematician is responsible for.
    Explain this result in detail as if your reader is a somewhat intelligent non-expert.
    Also, discuss the historical significance of this result.
    What impact did this result have on society, if any? This description should be no more than 2 pages.
</p>

<p>
    General Guidelines: Use a cover page to identify yourself and to cite the resources/sources used.
    The résumé and job letter should each be written in the appropriate formats.
    Complete sentences should be used where applicable.
    All items must be typed in 11 or 12-point black font (either Times New Roman, Arial, or Calibri).
    Use either single or 1.5 spacing.
    Campus Policy on Plagiarism Plagiarism is the act of presenting the ideas and writings of another as one’s own.
    Plagiarism is a violation of the Student Discipline Code and makes the offending student liable to penalties up to and including expulsion.
    Students must make appropriate acknowledgements of the original source where material written or compiled by another is used.
    Projects which are plagiarized will earn a score of 0.

<p>
    Resources (in addition to course textbooks) One of the many useful sites for biographies of mathematicians is the “MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive” at St.
    Andrews University.
    The webpage is http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk.
    The Career Center at CSUSB has a lot of information on writing résumés.
    Their website is http://career.csusb.edu and their office is located in UH 329.
    The Writing Center at CSUSB can help you with several aspects of this assignment including expanding ideas, clarifying organization, editing, and proofreading.
    Their website is https://www.csusb.edu/writing-center and their office is in CE 310 and CE 311.
</p>

<p>
    Deadlines Submit the name of your mathematician by Thursday May 9th on Google Docs.
    Submit the job your mathematician is applying for and at least one resource you are using by Thursday May 16th.
    This submission will be done through Blackboard.
    Submit your final project by Thursday May 30th by 11:59pm through Blackboard.
