         What do you notice about the surface and the plane?

      <url href="\href{https://davidmathlogic.com/amit/arclengthapproximation.html" visual="This applet" /> again created 
      by Dr. David Nichols, demonstrates the linear approximation which can be used to calculate arc 
      length. How large should <m>n</m> be in order to have the linear approximation be within 0.1
       of the actual arc length?

      The following question is designed to help you better understand the geometric meaning of the
       total differential and visually verify the answer. Determine the tangent plane of the surface 
       <m>z = f (x, y) = x^2 + xy + y^2 </m> at the point <m>(1, 0.5)</m> in its domain. 
       Use CalcPlot3D to print the graph of this surface (with â€“2 to 2 on <m>x-</m> and 
        <m>y-</m>axes) along with this tangent plane. Show the point of tangency.
    </p>

  </statement>
    <hint>
        <p>
        <alert>Note: </alert> To create this plot, first enter the function in a
        <alert> Function:</alert> <m>z = f(x, y)</m> panel. Then enter the tangent plane function
         (solved for z) in a second function panel. Graph these surfaces together. 
         Then choose <alert>Point </alert>: <m>(x, y, z)</m> from the <alert>Add to graph</alert> menu. 
         Enter the coordinates of the point on the surface, and keep the default values for the other 
         choices. To make it easier to see both surfaces, make them semi-transparent using either
          Ctrl-T or the
             <alert>Transparency toolbar button which looks like a magnifying glass</alert>.
             <!-- %answer: z = 1.75 + 2.5(x - 1) + 2(y - 0.5) -->

        The following activity, created by Dr. Katie Hall,
         uses Geogebra to help us visualize the tangent plane.
          First click <url href="\href{https://www.geogebra.org/3d/rqfs5bny)" visual="here" /> 
          <!-- (\url{https://www.geogebra.org/3d/rqfs5bny}) -->
           to access the demo and then follow the instructions below: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Once the demo is open, turn on the <em>Paraboloid </em> function 
                 (click the circle next to it) if it is not on already. 
                 If you would like to, play around with the <m>a</m> and <m>b </m> sliders as you please
                  until you find a shape that you want to work with. Notice the Point A sitting on
                   the surface of this function. You may move this point around as you please.
                    You will soon see the relevance and importance of this point.Turn on the 
                    TangentPlane function. Begin to move the point around again.
                     <alert>Question:</alert> How does the TangentPlane change in response to point
                      A's movements?
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                 Let's explore further
            </p>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    To view the x and y traces of the function, turn on <alert>XTrace</alert> and <alert>YTrace</alert>. 
                    You can keep these on to help visualize what's going on if you would like. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Click the circle next to NormalVector to view the normal vector to the function at point A. Move around the point to see how this vector changes.
                </p>
            </li>
