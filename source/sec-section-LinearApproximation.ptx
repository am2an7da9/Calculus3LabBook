         What do you notice about the surface and the plane?

      <url href="\href{https://davidmathlogic.com/amit/arclengthapproximation.html" visual="This applet" /> again created 
      by Dr. David Nichols, demonstrates the linear approximation which can be used to calculate arc 
      length. How large should <m>n</m> be in order to have the linear approximation be within 0.1
       of the actual arc length?

      The following question is designed to help you better understand the geometric meaning of the
       total differential and visually verify the answer. Determine the tangent plane of the surface 
       <m>z = f (x, y) = x^2 + xy + y^2 </m> at the point <m>(1, 0.5)</m> in its domain. 
       Use CalcPlot3D to print the graph of this surface (with â€“2 to 2 on <m>x-</m> and 
        <m>y-</m>axes) along with this tangent plane. Show the point of tangency.
    </p>

  </statement>
    <hint>
        <p>
        <alert>Note: </alert> To create this plot, first enter the function in a
        <alert> Function:</alert> <m>z = f(x, y)</m> panel. Then enter the tangent plane function
         (solved for z) in a second function panel. Graph these surfaces together. 
         Then choose <alert>Point </alert>: <m>(x, y, z)</m> from the <alert>Add to graph</alert> menu. 
         Enter the coordinates of the point on the surface, and keep the default values for the other 
         choices. To make it easier to see both surfaces, make them semi-transparent using either
          Ctrl-T or the
             <alert>Transparency toolbar button which looks like a magnifying glass</alert>.
             <!-- %answer: z = 1.75 + 2.5(x - 1) + 2(y - 0.5) -->
